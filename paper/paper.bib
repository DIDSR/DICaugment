  author    = "Solomon, Justin B and Christianson, Olav and Samei, Ehsan",
  abstract  = "PURPOSE: To quantitatively compare noise texture across computed
               tomography (CT) scanners from different manufacturers using the
               noise power spectrum (NPS). METHODS: The American College of
               Radiology CT accreditation phantom (Gammex 464, Gammex, Inc.,
               Middleton, WI) was imaged on two scanners: Discovery CT 750HD
               (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), and SOMATOM Definition Flash
               (Siemens Healthcare, Germany), using a consistent acquisition
               protocol (120 kVp, 0.625/0.6 mm slice thickness, 250 mAs, and 22
               cm field of view). Images were reconstructed using filtered
               backprojection and a wide selection of reconstruction kernels.
               For each image set, the 2D NPS were estimated from the uniform
               section of the phantom. The 2D spectra were normalized by their
               integral value, radially averaged, and filtered by the human
               visual response function. A systematic kernel-by-kernel
               comparison across manufacturers was performed by computing the
               root mean square difference (RMSD) and the peak frequency
               difference (PFD) between the NPS from different kernels. GE and
               Siemens kernels were compared and kernel pairs that minimized
               the RMSD and |PFD| were identified. RESULTS: The RMSD (|PFD|)
               values between the NPS of GE and Siemens kernels varied from
               0.01 mm(2) (0.002 mm(-1)) to 0.29 mm(2) (0.74 mm(-1)). The GE
               kernels ``Soft,'' ``Standard,'' ``Chest,'' and ``Lung'' closely
               matched the Siemens kernels ``B35f,'' ``B43f,'' ``B41f,'' and
               ``B80f'' (RMSD < 0.05 mm(2), |PFD| < 0.02 mm(-1), respectively).
               The GE ``Bone,'' ``Bone+,'' and ``Edge'' kernels all matched
               most closely with Siemens ``B75f'' kernel but with sizeable RMSD
               and |PFD| values up to 0.18 mm(2) and 0.41 mm(-1), respectively.
               These sizeable RMSD and |PFD| values corresponded to visually
               perceivable differences in the noise texture of the images.
               CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use the NPS to quantitatively
               compare noise texture across CT systems. The degree to which
               similar texture across scanners could be achieved varies and is
               limited by the kernels available on each scanner.",

  title     = "Cascaded systems analysis of the {3D} noise transfer
               characteristics of flat-panel cone-beam {CT}",
  author    = "Tward, Daniel J and Siewerdsen, Jeffrey H",
  abstract  = "The physical factors that govern 2D and 3D imaging performance
               may be understood from quantitative analysis of the
               spatial-frequency-dependent signal and noise transfer
               characteristics [e.g., modulation transfer function (MTF),
               noise-power spectrum (NPS), detective quantum efficiency (DQE),
               and noise-equivalent quanta (NEQ)] along with a task-based
               assessment of performance (e.g., detectability index). This
               paper advances a theoretical framework based on cascaded systems
               analysis for calculation of such metrics in cone-beam CT (CBCT).
               The model considers the 2D projection NPS propagated through a
               series of reconstruction stages to yield the 3D NPS and allows
               quantitative investigation of tradeoffs in image quality
               associated with acquisition and reconstruction techniques. While
               the mathematical process of 3D image reconstruction is
               deterministic, it is shown that the process is irreversible, the
               associated reconstruction parameters significantly affect the 3D
               DQE and NEQ, and system optimization should consider the full 3D
               imaging chain. Factors considered in the cascade include: system
               geometry; number of projection views; logarithmic scaling; ramp,
               apodization, and interpolation filters; 3D back-projection; and
               3D sampling (noise aliasing). The model is validated in
               comparison to experiment across a broad range of dose,
               reconstruction filters, and voxel sizes, and the effects of 3D
               noise correlation on detectability are explored. The work
               presents a model for the 3D NPS, DQE, and NEQ of CBCT that
               reduces to conventional descriptions of axial CT as a special
               case and provides a fairly general framework that can be applied
               to the design and optimization of CBCT systems for various
               applications.",
