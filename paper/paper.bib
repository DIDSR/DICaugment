  abstract  = "PURPOSE: To quantitatively compare noise texture across computed
               tomography (CT) scanners from different manufacturers using the
               noise power spectrum (NPS). METHODS: The American College of
               Radiology CT accreditation phantom (Gammex 464, Gammex, Inc.,
               Middleton, WI) was imaged on two scanners: Discovery CT 750HD
               (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), and SOMATOM Definition Flash
               (Siemens Healthcare, Germany), using a consistent acquisition
               protocol (120 kVp, 0.625/0.6 mm slice thickness, 250 mAs, and 22
               cm field of view). Images were reconstructed using filtered
               backprojection and a wide selection of reconstruction kernels.
               For each image set, the 2D NPS were estimated from the uniform
               section of the phantom. The 2D spectra were normalized by their
               integral value, radially averaged, and filtered by the human
               visual response function. A systematic kernel-by-kernel
               comparison across manufacturers was performed by computing the
               root mean square difference (RMSD) and the peak frequency
               difference (PFD) between the NPS from different kernels. GE and
               Siemens kernels were compared and kernel pairs that minimized
               the RMSD and |PFD| were identified. RESULTS: The RMSD (|PFD|)
               values between the NPS of GE and Siemens kernels varied from
               0.01 mm(2) (0.002 mm(-1)) to 0.29 mm(2) (0.74 mm(-1)). The GE
               kernels ``Soft,'' ``Standard,'' ``Chest,'' and ``Lung'' closely
               matched the Siemens kernels ``B35f,'' ``B43f,'' ``B41f,'' and
               ``B80f'' (RMSD < 0.05 mm(2), |PFD| < 0.02 mm(-1), respectively).
               The GE ``Bone,'' ``Bone+,'' and ``Edge'' kernels all matched
               most closely with Siemens ``B75f'' kernel but with sizeable RMSD
               and |PFD| values up to 0.18 mm(2) and 0.41 mm(-1), respectively.
               These sizeable RMSD and |PFD| values corresponded to visually
               perceivable differences in the noise texture of the images.
               CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use the NPS to quantitatively
               compare noise texture across CT systems. The degree to which
               similar texture across scanners could be achieved varies and is
               limited by the kernels available on each scanner.",
